= ltprotocol =

LTProtocol is a Twisted library extension written in Python. It provides a
Twisted-based client and server implementation for protocols which begin with a
length and type field.

Create your protocol by constructing an LTProtocol with a list of LTMessage
objects which specify your protocol.  Use LTTwistedServer and LTTwistedClient to
create a server or client.  You may wish to subclass these classes in order to
take custom actions when a client connects or disconnects.

== requirements ===

LTProtocol runs on Python version 2.5 or greater, with the following dependencies:
* [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Twisted/8.2.0]

== getting started ==

Take a look at the example at [http://dound.com/projects/python/ltprotocol/].

== changelog ==
v0.2.1 (2009-Sep-15):
 * Logging module now used in place of print calls
 * Added __str__() method for LTProtocol

v0.2.0 (2009-May-21):
 * LTTwistedClient now has a newly connected callback to match LTTwistedServer
 * Added optional callback which is fired when a connection is lost
 * Callbacks now passed an LTProtocol object vice LTProtocol.transport
 * send() now defined on LTProtocol vice LTProtocol.transport
 * LTProtocol now as a variable to track whether it is connected or not

v0.1.8 (2009-May-21):
 * move send() method so it is added all new LTTwistedProtocol objects (on
   connection initiation) rather than only adding it to server-side
   LTTwistedProtocol objects
 * extensibility fix: LTTwistedClient created a generic protocol instantiation
   rather than the specific one it was a client for
 * Typo fix in print statement
 * Thanks to Glen Gibb for suggestions for the above patches
 * Add option to turn off verbose printing

v0.1.7 (2009-May-01):
 * added send() method to connection object to make it easy to send messages
   from a connection without needing a reference to its parent server

v0.1.6 (2009-Apr-19):
 * added optional callback for when a client connections to the server

v0.1.5 (2009-Mar-09):
 * added param to recv_callback: transport layer

v0.1.4:
 * Removed extraneous print statement

v0.1.2:
 * Added support for specifying the size of the integers used to represent the
   length and type fields
