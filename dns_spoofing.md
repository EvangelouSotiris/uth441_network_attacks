# DNS SPOOFING ATTACK

## Preparation

In order to prepare for the DNS spoofing attack we need to have a victim machine's IP, the gateway's IP, and we need to be in the same local network as the targets.
In order to intercept all DNS requests from the victim we need to perform a MITM attack, so before moving on to this lab, one should perform the steps described in the [arp_spoofing](https://github.com/EvangelouSotiris/uth441_network_attacks/blob/master/arp_spoofing.md) markdown first.
